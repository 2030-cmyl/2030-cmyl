Could you please make a game that is in the genre of find the, some inspirations can be found in the game find the markers in Roblox, where there are different difficulty levels, and once you press on the corresponding marker, there is going to be the name of the marker and the brief description of the marker. An inspiration for a puzzle in order to find a hard to find object in this find the game could be something to do with encrypting, typing in codes, or could be something like Search for a space-like circle hidden in the Amethyst Abyss. The first few lines of text explain that you have to find a date and time somewhere in the "hub", which refers to the main realm. The month can be found in the cabin in Ice on the calendar. The month says "January", with "21" being circled. But in order to find the year, you have to look closely at the calendar to find transparent text that says "MDCCC", which is "1800" in Roman Numerals. To find the time, you have to go to the basement in Overgrowth to find an analog lock (not the one used for Chronophobik because that one is randomized). The clock says "23:05". which also means "11:05 PM". Using the format of the code that the text gives you, the code is "January 21 1800 11:05 PM". Once you say this, the circle opens, and you can move on to the next part, which is to decipher the 5 lines of text. But before that, you can find a sign underneath the main sign that explains that you need Vigenere cipher for all 5 codes, with the formatting involving the English alphabet, Numbers, and Greek Alphabet. The 5 lines show the ciphertext, but sometimes flash a clue on how to find the key for its text, which will be explained below:
First line: "Property unique to the second largest planet in the Solar System. Make an analogy regarding said property with things edible as greasy food. Be mindful of the gift from the gods above." - The 2nd largest planet is Saturn, and its unique feature is that it has rings. Onion rings are a greasy food related to rings, so the key is "onionrings". Using it for the key in the ciphertext will give: "Saturn - α Virginis"
Second line: "Search for it here. A term related to chemistry." - Search the Amethyst Abyss for a chemistry term. It can be found underneath a platform near the spaghetti structure. The key is "isopropyl". Using it in Vigenere, you get "α Boötis - β Leonis"
Third line: "A chomik has something to do with this code. The concept is related to the constellations, just like this one. Maybe search there." - This refers to the Chodiac. If you search its puzzle area in Revamp Realm, you get your key, "signsofthezodiac", which when used with Vigenere gives "α Scorpii - α Canis Majoris"
Fourth line: "What you seek is the title of where it is located. Watch the nEWS. Go. And once you go enough, you will know." - A bit vague, but this refers to Amethyst Abyss' '250' room for God Chomik. You can find the key, "northernedgeoftheworld", which gives: "ε Carinae - α Coronae Borealis"
Fifth line: "Continue your searches in Farmland. 2 words are missing out of the final ina__" - The "farmland" is referring to Apartment Floor 1. You can find a needle on top of a haystack, a reference to the saying "needle in a haystack", which fills in the blanks and is therefore the next key, "needleinahaystack". When used in Vigenere, you get: "β Ursae Minoris - α2 Centauri"
All of these final codes correspond to a certain star in the constellation. Use research to figure out where the stars are located and which ones you need to connect. You can connect the stars by clicking one, then the other. Do this for all five codes, and you will get the chomik
Please show an inventory, showing everything that you have, also once you collect something, please show a cool animation with a found, for the higher difficulties, show a more cooler animation. Also for the hardest difficulty, the text covers up 2 of the 5 that I have to click on, which then makes me not able to complete it. Please also do not show a menu with easy medium and hard and the other difficulties, please put them in one scattered around the place, harder ones are harder to find and have more difficult tasks that need to be completed. Please make these changes in order to make this game fulfil what I want it to look like.
